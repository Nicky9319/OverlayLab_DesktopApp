# Clerk + Electron + Vite Example Integration

**Repository:** [clerk/2025-11-13-clerk-electron-vite](https://github.com/clerk/2025-11-13-clerk-electron-vite)

This GitHub repository provides a detailed example of how to seamlessly and natively integrate [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/) authentication components into an Electron application that uses the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool.

By following the implementation in this repo, developers can learn how to:

- Use Clerk’s authentication and user interface components within an Electron desktop environment.
- Bridge the gap between the Clerk React components and the Electron renderer process.
- Properly configure both the main and renderer processes so Clerk authentication works securely and smoothly inside Electron apps.
- See best practices regarding secure IPC and environment configuration for authentication in Electron.

This makes it an excellent reference for anyone who wants to add robust, secure authentication with Clerk to a cross-platform desktop app powered by Electron and Vite.
